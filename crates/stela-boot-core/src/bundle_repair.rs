//! The automatic repair of a missing Metal plugin, `StelaGPU.bundle` in
//! `/Library/GPUBundles` on the Data volume.
//!
//! The StelaGPU kext writes the plugin's files from the copy it carries, but
//! the kernel gives a kext no way to create a directory (`files.h`:
//! `VNOP_MKDIR` is kernel-private and not in the kernel's symbol table the
//! kext is linked against), so on a
//! freshly installed system, whose Data volume holds only Apple's empty
//! `/Library/GPUBundles`, it reports the plugin missing. Nothing else can
//! create them before the first boot: the Data volume is encrypted, Stela's
//! APFS code only reads, and the restore runs Apple's own programs. A root
//! process of a normal boot is refused too: `/Library/GPUBundles` is
//! restricted, and the GPU policy's SIP grant keeps filesystem protection on.
//!
//! So a normal boot that finds the plugin missing records
//! [`BUNDLE_REPAIR_PENDING`] in NVRAM at its stop and restarts. The loader
//! turns that into one single-user boot with filesystem protection off
//! (`--bundle-repair`) and records [`BUNDLE_REPAIR_ATTEMPTED`] before it
//! boots, so neither a failure nor a power loss in the middle repeats the
//! repair by itself. In that boot the engine types [`steps`] at the guest's
//! root console ([`Driver`]), as the manual remedy does: it mounts the Data
//! volume, creates the plugin's directories root-owned and 0755, marks them
//! restricted, syncs, remounts it read-only and restarts quickly
//! ([`REBOOT`]). The next boot's kext then creates the
//! files in place. Only mounting and the directories are required: a
//! failing optional step is logged and the repair goes on. A failed
//! required step still syncs and restarts, and a repair whose shell stops
//! answering restarts the PC, so the next normal boot always tries the kext
//! once. A boot that finds the plugin installed removes the record; one
//! that finds it missing after an attempt stops with the manual remedy
//! ([`decide`]).
//!
//! A finished erase install knows the plugin is missing without a boot to
//! find it: it records [`BUNDLE_REPAIR_INSTALLED`] ([`Change::Installed`]),
//! which makes the first macOS boot the maintenance boot and is removed
//! before that boot starts. If that repair fails, the next normal boot finds
//! the plugin missing with no record and asks for the repair as above.
//!
//! The manual remedy's `xattr -w com.apple.rootless ...` is not a step: it
//! failed with EPERM in every manual installation (runs 20261106-070021,
//! 20261106-083218, 20261107-060417, and in this repair's first run), even
//! with filesystem protection off, and Metal loaded the plugin each time
//! without it. Whether Metal needs the restricted flag is unproven: every
//! manual installation set it, so the repair tries it but does not depend
//! on it.
