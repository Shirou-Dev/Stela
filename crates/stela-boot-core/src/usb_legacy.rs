//! Taking an xHCI controller from the firmware through its USB Legacy
//! Support capability (xHCI 7.1), as the firmware exits.

//! Some firmware keeps driving USB from system management mode after
//! ExitBootServices, for a keyboard in a boot loader with no USB driver,
//! until the operating system claims the controller. Linux claims every
//! controller in an early PCI fixup (`quirk_usb_handoff_xhci`), before
//! anything else touches it. Stela turns bus mastering off on every PCI
//! function before its own drivers start, and a controller the firmware
//! still runs then stops under the firmware's handler, so the claim is made
//! first, as the first act after the firmware's exit.
