//! What the screen says while Stela starts: one line per step, in the style
//! of a Linux boot, while every detail goes to the UART and the boot log
//! ([`output`]). A running step's line shows a moving marker, its time so
//! far and its progress, with lines such as macOS's console output under
//! it ([`stream`]), and its result replaces them when it ends:
//!
//! ```text
//!  [  ok  ]  Read Install macOS (484 MB, 12 s)
//!  [ ***  ]  Starting the macOS installer (46 s)  installer: fdr create
//!            AppleNVMe: controller ready
//! ```
//!
//! A finished line too long for the screen wraps under its text.
//!
//! [`tick`] moves the marker, at most eight frames a second: the firmware's
//! timer calls it while boot services run, and the host drivers' waits and
//! the engine's slices after. Finished lines are kept as [`history`], which
//! the loader hands to the system engine so its screen carries on from them
//! ([`replay`]). Each step's start and end store the boot logs, so a log
//! read after a hang ends at the step that hung.
